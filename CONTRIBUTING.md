We track bugs using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shivaay20005/shivaaymusic/issues). Before creating a new issue, please search existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If you find a similar issue, feel free to add relevant information or insights as a comment.

When creating a new issue, include:

* **Descriptive title** that summarizes the issue

* **Expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**
* **Environment details** (e.g., app version, device model, Android version)
* **Screenshots** if applicable
* **Relevant logs** if available

> \[!TIP]
> Use the provided templates to ensure you include all the necessary details.

### Suggesting Features

We also handle feature suggestions through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shivaay20005/shivaaymusic/issues). When suggesting a new feature:

* **Describe the problem** the feature is intended to solve
* **Explain the solution** and how it would work
* **Provide examples** or use cases if possible
* **Assess the scope** of the feature: is it minor, moderate, or large in terms of implementation effort?

3. **Write or update tests** as needed to cover your changes.
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting your PR.
5. **Update the documentation** if your changes affect the public API or usage instructions.
6. **Submit your pull request** with a **clear, concise, and informative description**.

Your PR description should include:

* **Purpose**: What problem does this PR solve? What feature or fix does it introduce?
* **Motivation**: Why is this change necessary or useful? How does it improve the project?
* **Implementation details**: Briefly explain how the changes were implemented.

* **XML**: Use 4 spaces for indentation
* **Variable and function names**: Use `camelCase` (e.g., `playbackController`)
* **Class names**: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `AudioPlayer`)

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep commit history clean and meaningful:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Common types**:

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation-only changes
* `style`: Changes that do not affect functionality (formatting, whitespace, etc.)
* `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
* `perf`: Code changes that improve performance
* `test`: Adding or fixing tests
* `chore`: Changes to build scripts or auxiliary tools

**Examples**:

```
feat(player): add support for offline playback
fix(ui): resolve layout bug in song list
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

---

### Documentation

* Write documentation in **Markdown**
* Document all public classes and functions
* Include **usage examples** whenever possible
* Keep the documentation **up to date** with code changes

---

## Development Process

### Git Workflow

We use a structured branching model:

* `main`: The production-ready branch
* `develop`: The active development branch
* `feature/xyz`: New feature branches
* `fix/xyz`: Bug fix branches
* `release/xyz`: Release preparation branches

---

### Pull Request Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: A contributor opens a PR from a feature/fix branch
2. **Review**: Maintainers review the code and provide feedback
3. **CI Validation**: Automated tests are run
4. **Discussion**: Issues are resolved and necessary changes are made
5. **Approval**: Once approved, the PR is ready for merging
6. **Merge**: The PR is merged into the target branch
